Saad did the takeTicket(), checkForSpace(), payForParking(), leaveGarage().
takeTicket(): checks if there is space available and if there is, it allows the user to buy a ticket and enter their car's license number.
checkForSpace(): prints the space availability.
payForParking(): allows the user to pay for the ticket and returns their change if any remaining.
leaveGarage(): checks to see if the user has paid and if they are able to match the license number. If they are able to then it allows the user to leave the garage.

Chris did the surveyTip() and the run().
surveyTip(): asks the user for review on our services and asks if they would like to leave a tip.
run(): calls all the other functions and lets the users navigate.
